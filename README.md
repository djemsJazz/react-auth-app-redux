## Simple React Auth App Template - Auth Managed With Redux

I created this repos, in order to have an out of the box react auth app.

**Feel free to use it :)**

I followed Ã  Module (Feature) based project strucutre.
The advantage of this structure is to have all the components, styles, logics and others that concerns and entity or a specific feature into a single place. So all the App Pages are into `src/modules` folder.

I Put the common/shared components into `shared` folder.

I Also created a `routing` folder that will includes everything that concerns routing, for now it contains only the **MainRouter**

I Also creating a Store (Redux) to manage the Auth

### Let's talk about some shared components :)

`<ProtectedLayout />`: You can find it in `src/shared/components/layout/ProtectedLayout.tsx`. This is a helper components that we can use to wrape many **private/protected routes**, This saves us from writing **ugly** condition rendering et redirecting every time we have a of routes (it gives us a very clean result), it checks if the user `isAuthenticated`, if it is it return the `Outlet` othewise it **Redirect** to the login page, here is an usage example:

```js
<Route element={<ProtectedLayout />}>
  <Route path="/protected-route-1" element={<ProtectedPage1 />} />
  <Route path="/protected-route-2" element={<ProtectedPage2 />} />
  .
  .
  <Route path="/protected-route-n" element={<ProtectedPagen />} />
</Route>
```

`<ProtectedRoute/>`: You can find it in `src/shared/components/protected-route/index.tsx`. it's the same principle with **ProtectedLayout** but for a single route it checks if the user ``, if it is it return the `children` othewise it **Redirect** to the login page, here is an usage example:

```jsx
 <Route path="/protected-route" element={<ProtectedRoute><ProtectedPage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```

`<ProtectedLink/>`: You can find it in `src/shared/components/protected-link/index.tsx`. this is a components that can use for both **private Link and NavLink**, so if the user `isAuthenticated` it will return the `Link` of the `NavLink` based on the `inNav` prop, otherwise it return nothing, here is an usage example:

```jsx
<ProtectedLink inNav to="/private-link" end>Private</ProtectedLink>
```
